## Hi there 👋

<h2>🙋‍♀️ A short introduction</h2>
Hello Stranger! We are an organization called The Interstellar Programmers, this organiztion is dedicated to making small programming projects with a variety of languages!
<br>
<h2>🌈 Contribution guidelines</h2>
If you want to Contribute to any of our projects, we are very welcome with PR(Pull Requests) and Issues, this helps us improve our code and make it even better!<br><br>
Below are a Few Notes for Contribution:<br>
- Pull Requests must be specific (Such as titles like "Problem" and with little description, instead, it should be like "Problem/Bug with ...", Description )<br>
- Do not ask low-level questions, (e.g. Why isn't the code working? | How to install) instead read the documentation first, and search for answers online, then if it is still not working, then ask the questions with steps to reproduce the error or an explaination.<br>
