## Hi there 👋

<h2>🙋‍♀️ A short introduction</h2>
Hello Stranger! We are an organization called The Interstellar Programmers, this organiztion is dedicated to making small programming projects with a variety of languages!
<br>
<h2>🌈 Contribution guidelines</h2>
If you want to Contribute to any of our projects, we are very welcome with PR(Pull Requests) and Issues, this helps us improve our code and make it even better!<br><br>
Below are a Few Notes for Contribution:<br>
- Pull Requests **must be specific** (Such as titles like "Problem" and with little description, instead, it should be like "Problem/Bug with ...", Description )<br>
- Please Do not ask low-level questions, (e.g. Why isn't the code working? | How to install) instead read the documentation first, and search for answers online, then if it is still not working, then ask the questions with steps to reproduce the error or an explaination.<br>
<br>
<h2>👩‍💻 Useful resources</h2>
The Docs would be normally located in the nav bar of a repo, if there is none, that means the project is old/deprecated/not production-ready.<br>
The Discussion section would be open on some big repos, where there is large amounts of code to manage, otherwise look for issues<br>
<br>
<h2>🍿 Fun facts</h2>
- I eat oatmeal for breakfast :3 (Leo).<br>
- William is a virus maker (troll viruses bascially, no harm, eh?)<br>
- David (*a.k.a. MelonsAtNight) is good at math<br><br>
